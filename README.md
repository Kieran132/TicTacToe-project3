## Project Goals
The aim of this project was to showcase backend technology Python. I felt that creating something interactive and fun would be more engaging and also more user friendly for the user. This quick simple game of Tic Tac Toe, really hypes up the competitiveness of both users to the point where they want to keep playing until either has at leat won once.

## Existing Features
Throughout playing this terminal based games, it is a very simple step by step process. A selection had to be made before the game can progress and be playable.

#### Name Entry

To make the game more personal and exciting having the users name on the system playing against another person. This input adds a sense of drive and determination to win at the game. Once the user inputs their name, this is used througout the game by telling the player it is their turn or if they win the game.

#### Player Symbol Choice

Once name inputs have been entered, the terminal asks a player to choose between X or O. The user then enters X or O and the programme will continue

#### Both Player Symbol Choice

Depending on what letter is selected initially, the game will then get the second users name and tell them which symbol they are. The to start the game, the user will hit enter

#### Player One First Go

Once enter has been hit, the terminal will tell a player it is their turn, then give them the option of selecting a row.

#### Row and Column Choice

The terminal will ask for both a row and column selection and details of where each selection is, is given in the question for the user.

#### Placement on the Grid

Once a player has correctly inputted the correct range, the game will show their input as a placement on the grid with the symbol they have been assigned

#### Showing the Winner

<img src="assests/README.md photos/shows_winner.png">

If a player has managed to get a row of 3 of their symbol then the game will stop and a message will show tellng the players who is the winner

#### Showing a Tie

<img src="assests/README.md photos/shows_tie.png">

If the game come to the conclusion that neither player was able to get a row of three, then the game will finish the game and highlight the game is a tie and the game is over.

#### Invalid Input

<img src="assests/README.md photos/invalid-entry.png">

For a valid input the be entered, the user must enter the correct value. However, if the user chooses a number or character outside the parameters then an invalid message will show up to the user asking them to reselect within the correct range of values.

#### Already Selected Space

<img src="assests/README.md photos/already_selected.png">

Playing a game like this with multiple inputs, it can be difficult to rememeber which space the other player has selected. If a player chooses a space that has already been chosen, a message will appear telling them that and asking to choose another.
