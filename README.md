## Project Goals
The aim of this project was to showcase backend technology Python. I felt that creating something interactive and fun would be more engaging and also more user friendly for the user. This quick simple game of Tic Tac Toe, really hypes up the competitiveness of both users to the point where they want to keep playing until either has at leat won once.

## Existing Features
Throughout playing this terminal based games, it is a very simple step by step process. A selection had to be made before the game can progress and be playable.

#### Name Entry

To make the game more personal and exciting having the users name on the system playing against another person. This input adds a sense of drive and determination to win at the game. Once the user inputs their name, this is used througout the game by telling the player it is their turn or if they win the game.

#### Player Symbol Choice

Once name inputs have been entered, the terminal asks a player to choose between X or O. The user then enters X or O and the programme will continue

#### Both Player Symbol Choice

Depending on what letter is selected initially, the game will then get the second users name and tell them which symbol they are.
