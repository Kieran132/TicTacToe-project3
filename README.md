## Project Goals
The aim of this project was to showcase backend technology Python. I felt that creating something interactive and fun would be more engaging and also more user friendly for the user. This quick simple game of Tic Tac Toe, really hypes up the competitiveness of both users to the point where they want to keep playing until either has at leat won once.

## Existing Features
Throughout playing this terminal based games, it is a very step by step process in the way one cannot be moved onto unless the previous one has been selected
